## Short-term Memory


## Long-term Memory

- [Mem0](https://mem0.ai/):  a universal, self-improving memory layer that semantically extracts and stores user preferences and past interaction facts across sessions to provide highly personalized AI experiences.
- [Zep](https://www.getzep.com/): a context engineering platform that uses a temporal knowledge graph to help AI agents remember, summarize, and retrieve relevant facts and conversation history across long-term user sessions.

## Working (Filesystem Memory)

- [AgentFS](https://github.com/tursodatabase/agentfs): is a portable, SQLite-backed virtual filesystem that acts as a persistent "hard drive" for AI agents, allowing them to manage files, key-value state, and tool logs in a structured way that complements orchestration frameworks
