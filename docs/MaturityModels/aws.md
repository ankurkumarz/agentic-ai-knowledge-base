# AWS's Perspective on Agentic AI Maturity

## Overview

AWS provides a comprehensive maturity model for generative AI that organizations can use to assess their current capabilities and plan their journey toward advanced agentic AI implementations. This model focuses on practical implementation stages and provides clear guidance for enterprise adoption.

## Maturity Model for Generative AI

AWS defines four distinct levels in their generative AI maturity model, each representing a progressive stage of organizational capability and implementation sophistication.

*The four levels of the generative AI maturity model: envision, experiment, launch, and scale.*

### Level 1: Envision
- **Focus**: Strategy development and use case identification
- **Characteristics**: Initial exploration of AI possibilities
- **Key Activities**: Business case development, stakeholder alignment, initial proof of concepts

### Level 2: Experiment
- **Focus**: Pilot implementations and learning
- **Characteristics**: Controlled experimentation with AI agents
- **Key Activities**: Prototype development, skill building, risk assessment

### Level 3: Launch
- **Focus**: Production deployment of AI agents
- **Characteristics**: Operational AI systems with defined governance
- **Key Activities**: Production deployment, monitoring implementation, user training

### Level 4: Scale
- **Focus**: Enterprise-wide optimization and innovation
- **Characteristics**: Mature AI operations with continuous improvement
- **Key Activities**: Performance optimization, advanced use cases, strategic innovation
