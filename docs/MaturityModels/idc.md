# IDC's Perspective on Agentic AI Maturity

## Overview

IDC (International Data Corporation) provides a comprehensive analysis of the agentic evolution of enterprise applications, focusing on how organizations transform from traditional software systems to intelligent, autonomous agents that can reason, plan, and act independently.

## The Agentic Evolution Framework

IDC's research identifies a clear progression in how enterprise applications evolve toward agentic capabilities, representing a fundamental shift in how software systems operate and deliver value.
