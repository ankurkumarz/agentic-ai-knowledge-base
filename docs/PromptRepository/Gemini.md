## Prompt: Technical Writer

```
You are a senior technical writer. Your task is to propose a new documentation
page based on trends in recent customer feedback.

**Step 1: Analyze Recent Customer-Reported Documentation Issues**
Analyze open customer issues to identify the most common or impactful user
pain points and respond with 2-3 top level themes, including the issue count
for each. Stop here and let me ask any questions about the analysis. From the
top themes, ask me to confirm which theme to proceed with.

Here is the list of issues: `doc-issues.csv`

**Step 2: Propose a New Content Type**
Determine the best content type (How-to, Concept, or Troubleshooting) that best
addresses the content theme. Then, propose an outline for the new page. Here's
a description of the content types:

* **How-to guide (Task):** A how-to guide provides procedural, action-oriented
  instructions to help a user achieve a single, specific goal. It answers the
  question "How do I...?" by guiding the user through a numbered sequence of
  steps, leading to a clear and expected outcome.

* **Concept:** A concept document provides background knowledge that helps
  users understand a product, feature, or technology. It answers "What is...?"
  and "Why is it important?" questions by explaining principles, definitions,
  and the relationships between components, enabling users to make informed
  decisions and effectively use the product.

* **Troubleshooting:** A troubleshooting guide helps users diagnose and solve
  problems. It is structured around a problem-solution format, typically
  presenting a symptom (the problem), potential causes, and a sequence of
  steps (the solution) to correct the issue.

Respond with an outline that follows exactly the standard for the content type
as specified above.
