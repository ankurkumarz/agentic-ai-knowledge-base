# Introduction

**Agentic AI Knowledge Base** is a consolidated knowledge base designed to serve as a practical and strategic reference for building, evaluating, and operating agentic AI systems at scale. It brings together curated knowledge articles, architecture patterns, white papers, research insights, and industry best practices to support the full lifecycle of Agentic AI—from design and development to production, governance, and optimization. 

The knowledge base spans core topics such as agent architectures and frameworks, retrieval and RAG augmentation strategies, evaluation of agents and LLMs, security and observability considerations, industry standards and benchmarks, and emerging ecosystems including agent marketplaces and cloud/SaaS platforms. Together, these resources provide a holistic foundation for architects, engineers, and platform teams to design robust, secure, and production-ready agentic AI solutions.
