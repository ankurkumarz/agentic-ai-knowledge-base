# Agent Types

## Classification of AI Agents

AI agents can be classified based on various characteristics including their capabilities, architecture, and application domains.

## By Capability Level

### 1. Simple Reflex Agents
- React to current percepts only
- No memory of past events
- Follow condition-action rules
- **Example**: Basic chatbots, simple automation scripts

### 2. Model-Based Reflex Agents
- Maintain internal state/model of the world
- Can handle partially observable environments
- **Example**: Navigation systems, game AI

### 3. Goal-Based Agents
- Have explicit goals and objectives
- Plan actions to achieve desired outcomes
- **Example**: Task planning agents, scheduling systems

### 4. Utility-Based Agents
- Optimize for utility/performance measures
- Can handle conflicting goals
- **Example**: Resource optimization agents, trading systems

### 5. Learning Agents
- Improve performance through experience
- Adapt to new situations
- **Example**: Recommendation systems, adaptive interfaces

## By Architecture Type

### Single-Agent Systems
- Operate independently
- Self-contained decision making
- **Use Cases**: Personal assistants, content generation

### Multi-Agent Systems
- Multiple agents working together
- Coordination and communication protocols
- **Use Cases**: Distributed problem solving, simulation systems

## By Application Domain

### Conversational Agents
- Natural language interaction
- Context understanding
- **Examples**: ChatGPT, Claude, customer service bots

### Task Automation Agents
- Process automation
- Workflow orchestration
- **Examples**: RPA bots, CI/CD agents

### Research and Analysis Agents
- Information gathering and synthesis
- Data analysis and reporting
- **Examples**: Research assistants, market analysis tools

### Creative Agents
- Content generation
- Design and artistic creation
- **Examples**: Image generators, writing assistants

### Decision Support Agents
- Data analysis and recommendations
- Risk assessment
- **Examples**: Financial advisors, medical diagnosis aids

## Emerging Agent Types

### Agentic AI Systems
- Advanced reasoning capabilities
- Tool use and integration
- Multi-step problem solving
- **Examples**: Code generation agents, scientific research agents

### Autonomous Agents
- Minimal human supervision
- Self-directed goal pursuit
- **Examples**: AutoGPT, autonomous vehicles
