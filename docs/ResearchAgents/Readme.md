# Research Agents

- [Jenni.ai](https://jenni.ai/): For researchers, team's & institutional usage, literature review generator
- [Elicit](https://elicit.com/): Research Paper AI Agent
- [DeepAgent](https://deepagent.abacus.ai/): Built by Abacus AI (od-tier general-purpose agent capable of complex tasks.)
- [Skywork.ai](https://skywork.ai): DeepResearch-Powered Workspace Super Agents (Singapore). offers five expert agents—each dedicated to a key task: writing documents, analyzing spreadsheets, building presentations, producing podcasts, and creating websites.
- [Jina AI](https://jina.ai/): Berlin-based Jina.ai, an open source startup that uses neural search to help its users find information in their unstructured data. Xiao described Jina as akin to TensorFlow for search.

## Super Agents

- [Genspark](https://www.genspark.ai/): AI Agent Engine built by ex-Baidu leaders, One of Genspark's defining innovations is the concept of "Sparkpages"—custom-generated pages that are created in real-time in response to user queries. 
- [Manus AI](https://manus.im/): an autonomous artificial intelligence agent developed by startup company Monica, based in Singapore. A multi-agent system, combining different AI models, including a fine-tuned version of Alibaba's Qwen models and potentially Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet, to handle complex tasks autonomously. 
- [AgentSeek](https://github.com/Fosowl/agenticSeek): Local alternative to Manus AI, this voice-enabled AI assistant autonomously browses the web, writes code, and plans tasks while keeping all data on your device.

## Opensource

- [DeeeFlow](https://deerflow.tech/): Community-driven Deep Research Framework (MIT License), built by Bytedance (Chinese company behind Tiktok)
- [GPT Researher](https://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher): Built with LangGraph's multi-agent system, it delivers thorough, citation-backed research in minutes
- [SurfSense](https://www.surfsense.net/): A Customizable AI Research Agent just like NotebookLM or Perplexity
- [Google Reference App for Research Agent](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-fullstack-langgraph-quickstart): Google, in collaboration with contributors from Hugging Face and other open-source communities, has developed a full-stack research agent stack designed to solve this problem. Built with a React frontend and a FastAPI + LangGraph backend
