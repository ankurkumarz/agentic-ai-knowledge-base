# CrewAI

## Overview

CrewAI is a framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents. CrewAI emerged as a promising multi-agent framework to build and deploy workflow-based applications with support from a wide array of LLMs and Cloud providers. It enables the creation of collaborative agent teams where each agent has specific roles, goals, and tools to accomplish complex tasks together.

## Suitable for (Pros)

- **CrewAI has emerged as the fastest growing AI agents ecosystem** and raised funding of $18M in Oct 2024. The simplicity of creating business-friendly agents has made it easy to understand realizing the value of GenAI quickly
- **Quicker time-to-market** with out-of-the-box customization and more suitable for building lightweight agents such as marketing agents
- **Business-friendly approach**: Simplified approach to creating practical business applications
- **Rapid development**: Quick setup and deployment of multi-agent systems
- **Growing ecosystem**: Fast-growing community and ecosystem support
- **Workflow-based applications**: Excellent for structured, workflow-driven use cases

## Where other frameworks flare better (Cons)

- **The ability to handle large enterprise-specific complex scenarios** with data integration has not been production-tested and will need to be assessed in the future
- **The vendor dependency and lock-in** have been a key consideration and the possibility of CrewAI to be acquired by one of the hyperscalers or other players remains an open question
- **Limited enterprise testing**: Less proven in large-scale enterprise deployments
- **Acquisition uncertainty**: Potential concerns about future ownership and direction
